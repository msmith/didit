### Tech

* Front-end is React.js, Redux & Material-UI
* Data is stored in the browser's localStorage
* Built and packaged with Babel & Webpack
* App is 100% static and served by AWS S3


### How to run

* `npm start` - Starts a local web server at http://localhost:3000
* `npm run test` - Runs all tests
* `npm run build` - Compiles all files into `build/`
* `npm run serve` - Runs a local web server that serves the files from `build/`
* `npm run deploy` - Deploys all files from `build/` to S3

### Thanks

* [React.js Boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate) was used to jump start this app
* [Material UI](material-ui.com) makes it work well on mobile and look good
